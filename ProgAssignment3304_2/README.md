In this project, the program is given an input file(file is included in the folder) 
of different types of media like movies or music. The program uses the input file to create a media structure
which unions with a different struct based on the type of media. These media structs are then stored in an array
using pointers and dynamic memory allocation. The program then uses bubble sort and an accompanying swap 
method to sort the media and print the result to an output file. At the end it then frees all of the 
dynamically allocated memory.
