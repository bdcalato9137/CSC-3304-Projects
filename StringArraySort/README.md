This program takes a text file of string as input and then reads from the file placing 
the strings into an array. The program then uses a bubble sort and accompanying swap method to sort 
the strings of the array. It then prints out the sorted strings onto an output file and frees all pointers to
free the memory. Includes the shellfile for the project.
