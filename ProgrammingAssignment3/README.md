Similar to another project, this takes an input file of strings and creates an array of pointers to the strings.
It then uses bubble sort and an accompanying swap routine to sort the strings and print them to an output file.
It then frees all of the allocated memory. The difference with this project from the other String Array Sorter
project is this one has no limit on the amount of strings, so the array has to be dynamically allocated as it hits
its limits to increase the amount of pointers it has. It also includes the use of a separate C file and a Header file.
